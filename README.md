### Earthquakes
Read the table of earthquakes from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_deadly_earthquakes_since_1900 using *beautifulsoup* and load to a pandas dataframe.

Data cleaning tasks include:
1. Replace empty strings with NaN
2. Remove the footnotes from the 'Other Source Deaths' column
3. Convert Magnitude to a numeric
4. Create a new column ('deaths') that evaluates the four total-death columns ('PDE Total Deaths', 'Utsu Total Deaths', 'EM-DAT Total Deaths', and 'Other Source Deaths') and populates the new column with the highest value.
5. Explore the data in terms of when and where earthquakes occurred and how severe they were (magnitude, deaths, secondary effects).

Feel free to add data after 9/23/2011, but understand that it is not required.
Add any supplemental data you'd like in order to explore ideas related to earthquake occurrence and effects.
